		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose for this lab is to work with CSS selectors when stylizing
		 our site.</p>

	<div id="challenges">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> There was not necessarily anything that gave me any trouble throughout
		the lab, but learning about all the selectors during class was quite
	  overwhelming. The concepts themselves weren't too difficult to understand
	  there was just a lot of different versions.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Well, you should be seeing the product of my work right now on my website,
		the styling created through CSS selectors, and my image should change size
	  when you hover over it!</p>
