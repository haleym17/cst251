	<div id="purpose">
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose for this lab is to work with CSS selectors when stylizing
		 our site.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="challenges">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> Learning about all the selectors during class was quite
	  overwhelming. The concepts themselves weren't too difficult to understand
	  there was just a lot of different versions. I was tired and kind of moody
	  when I started the lab so I was a bit more frustrated when things didn't
	  work out on the first try. I was finally able to get it to work, but I had
	  to have my partner's help when figuring out how to do the image sizing when
	  hovering over it.</p>
		<div id="results">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Well, you should be seeing the product of my work right now on my website,
		the styling created through CSS selectors, and my image should change size
	  when you hover over it!</p>
