	<div id="purpose">
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose for this lab is to build on our CSS knowledge from the
		previous lab and add to it with border modifications, and the additions of
	  padding and margins. So essentially, this lab is style focused.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="challenges">
		<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
		<p> Surprisingly I had no issues with this lab, and most things worked
		 on the first try which they usually don't. I mostly messed around with different
	   ways to style certain aspects of the site by looking on w3schools; I've found that
	   said website is super helpful and a solid resource to refer to while styling.
	   Everything I seem to be needing is on there, and I appreciate that they
	 	 allow us to "try it out" as well to see the exact coding for the tool.</p> </div>

		<div id="results">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>If everything has gone to plan-- which I know it has since I wouldn't have
		stopped this assignment until it was done correctly-- then, you should be seeing
	  a stylized webpage. This page should contain a stylized image, borders, and
	  margins/padding which make the content well spaced out and organized neatly.</p>
