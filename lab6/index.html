	<h1>Lab 6 More Complicated HTML</h1>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this particular lab is to create an html file and style it
	with a CSS file.</p>
	<img
	 src="img/magician_tarot.jpeg" alt="img/magician_tarot.jpeg" width=250 height=400>
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p>Surprisingly, I did not come across any problems during this lab even though
	this marked my first attempt at styling a lab with a CSS file. Everything so
  far seems to come down to memorization and precision, and I can only hope that
	 with time I hope I am able to remember most of the tags without having to look
   at past assignments.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>If done correctly, you are currently looking at the product of my CSS file
		style attempt! </p>
