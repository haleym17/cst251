			<p> I am a sag sun, aqua moon, and a cancer rising.<br>
			I have a grey kitten named stormi, <br>and a gecko named tiberius.<br>
		  I hate having my picture taken, like absolutely detest it.<br>
		  Crime shows are my favorite,<br> and gore hasn't ever bothered me.<br>
		  I prefer being alone and am easily bothered by others.<br>
		  I am an overthinker but usually end up not caring.<br>
		  I love books and would rather read over anything else.<br>
		  My favorite color is red, any variation of red.<br>
		  I cannot function without music playing.<br>
		  As I have gotten older I have grown <br> to dislike most school subjects.<br>

			A poem I love, by weareallboats:<br>
			<br>
			"Here is what they don't tell you<br>
			Icarus laughed as he fell<br>
			threw his head back and<br>
			yelled into the winds,<br>
			arms spread wide,<br>
			teeth bared to the world.<br>
			There is a bitter triumph<br>
			in crashing<br>
			when you should be <br>
			soaring.<br>
			The wax scorched his skin,<br>
			ran blazing trails down his back,<br>
			his thighs,<br>
			his ankles,<br>
			his feet.<br>
			Feathers floated like prayers<br>
			past his fingers,<br>
			close enough to snatch back.<br>
			Death breathed burning kisses<br>
			against his shoulders,<br>
			where the wings joined <br>
			the harness.<br>
			The sun painted everything,<br>
			in shades of gold.<br>
			There is a certain beauty,<br>
			in setting the world<br>
			on fire,<br>
			and watching from the center<br>
			of the flames."<br>

			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>Hi! The purpose of this lab is to work more with block level styling.
			The difference from this and the previous labs on block styling is that
		  now we are messing around with the overall layout sections like "aside"
		  which you should be able to see right now.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="challenges">
			<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
			<p>Well, I did have trouble doing the aside bar without using float: right,
			I have a vague memory of being told not to do that during class but that
		  was the only way it was able to go in the correct position. I am aware that
		  there were parameters set on iLearn for the aside bar but when I tried doing
		  in-line block nothing would change. So, as of this moment that particular
		  part is something that I need to work on in the next lab if there will
		  be another side bar. </p> </div>

			<div id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>If everything has gone to plan then my site should have a sidebar of
			text that provides some random facts about myself. Also, the top of my
		  page should stay in the same place even when you scroll down.</p></div>
