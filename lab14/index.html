			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this lab isn't too different from the previous one, they
			are essentially the same except this one is mimicing a more difficult site!
		  Nonetheless, the purpose is to use block-level and typography css to
			recreate a website. </p>

			<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
			<p>#1 challenge was fighting the urge to crawl under my covers and fall asleep.
			This lab wasn't much more difficult than the last one even though it definitely
		  was ten times more complex than the basic minimal one I did before. The most
		  challenging aspect with this copy lab was getting the triangle cuts at the bottom
		  to work out, and also getting the button text on top of the triangle button.</p>
