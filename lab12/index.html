		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>Hey! The purpose of this lab is to collaborate with my partner to design
		our sites with some more advanced block level styling. In this particular
	  lab we are working with centering text and images. Soooo, let's see how
	  this goes. </p>

		<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
		<p>I am irritable and tired and want to sleep so bad. I don't know if this
		lab is extra hard or my half functioning brain cannot handle it at the moment.
	   I take it back it's functioning about an eighth of what it usually does.
	   I had some trouble getting my images to go into the correct place.
	  Particularly the one that was supposed to go on the righ side of the site.
	  I felt like a mess throughout this whole lab but was finally able to get it
	  looking how I wanted yayayaya. Feel so tired yet accomplished now goodnight.</p>
	 </main>

 <main id="results">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>If everything has gone to plan then my site should visually look quite
		different than it usually does, now it should have some centered images and
	  text. And then as always, this site was created with a new lab12 folder,
	  css stylesheet, img folder, and index.html that I had to make.</p></div>

<div id="floated">
	<p>This is some sample text, but instead of the random latin it is going to
	be the poem I had in my last lab. "Here is what they don't tell you
	Icarus laughed as he fell threw his head back and yelled into the winds,
	arms spread wide, teeth bared to the world.
	There is a bitter triumph in crashing	when you should be soaring.
	The wax scorched his skin, ran blazing trails down his back, his thighs,
	his ankles, his feet.
	Feathers floated like prayers	past his fingers, close enough to snatch back.
	Death breathed burning kisses against his shoulders,
	where the wings joined the harness.
	The sun painted everything,in shades of gold.
	There is a certain beauty, in setting the world on fire, and watching from
  the center of the flames."</p>

<div id="center-horz">
	<p> This is sample text, but instead a peom repeated. Why are humans so careless
		with something so precious? Why are humans so careless with something so
		precious? Why are humans so careless with something so precious? Why are
		humans so careless with something so precious? Why are humans so careless
		with something so precious? Why are humans so careless with something
		so precious? Why are humans so careless with something so precious?</p>
