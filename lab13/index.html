			<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
			<p>This website was honestly probably one of the easiest..but I do tend
			to doubt my abilities and I thought this would be safe to do as a first
		  attempt at copying. With that said, since it was so minimal I did not have
		  any problems really except for finding the correct fonts. The darn subheader
		  type text was so hard to find %$#$%, the "g" was difficult because with this
			particular font the italic had a regular g, and the normal version was the
			google type g. ARGHH I am disappointed that I wasn't able to locate a perfectly
		  matched font.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here are my results! With these particular dimesions the website looks
			kind of wonky to be honest, but if it is wide enough it translates how I wanted.
