	<p> A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes I screamed <br>
		aloud as it tore through them. And now it's left me blind. The stars,<br>
		the moon, they have all been blown out.<br>
		<br>
		You left me in the dark. No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight<br>
		in the shadows of your heart. And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat<br>
		I tried to find the sound. But then it stopped and I was in the darkness<br>
		So darkness I became. The satrs, the moon, they have all been blown out.<br>
	  You have left me in the dark.</p>

		We should go back to Arkansas, trade this body for that can of gin. <br>
