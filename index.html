		<h1>Haley's Hangout</h1>
		<div>
		<p>Hi my name is Haley, in all honesty I wish we were allowed to write our
		names without capitilization all the time because h looks better than H. When
		it comes to talking about myself, I feel like it's hard to know what to say
		because I know everything about me. But what parts of myself should I share
		with others? Yeah, that question serves as a total road block. Anyways, I am 19,
		a sagittarius, and a mom to a cat and a gecko. I feel like sometimes I come off
		as cold towards people, it's not intentional at all, I just focus on what I
		think is important.</p><br>

	  <p>I am addicted to reading YA/NA romance and fantasy books, I read at least 100
	  a year :p Depending on how much homework I have, I typically finish a book a day;
	  reading has somehow became my favorite thing to do in my free time. When I'm
	  in a book slump I typically binge a tv series or rewatch some of my favorites.
	  I sometimes wonder if I have an addictive personality because once I like
	  something I will do/watch/listen/read it repeatedly. My sophomore year of
	  high school I went on independent studies as aftermath of a certain injury,
	  and I would watch John Wick several times a day-- my parents got sick of it.</p><br>
