			 <h2>Purpose</h2>
			 <p>This lab's purpose is to mess around with layout using CSS layout tools.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="challenges">
			 <h2>Challanges</h2>
			 <p>Have not done anything css wise, but first challenge is resisting falling
			 asleep. Sleeping is my bestfriend. Okay, so as for using float, it was
			 not as bad as I expected because my partner has been playing around with
			 this lab for a while so I thought it would take me just as long if not longer.
			 It was a welcome suprise that it did not take as long, or at least not as long
			 as I had anticipated but now checking the time I still did put in a good
			 3-4 hours on this. My layout is quite simple to be honest but it also isn't
			 set up like any of my previous labs either. </p>

			 <h2>Results</h2>
			 <p>I hope everything is right or I might have a nervous breakdown and cry.</p>
