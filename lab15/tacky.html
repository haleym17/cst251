			<p> Wild Embers, Nikita Gill:<br>
			<br>
			We are the descendants<br>
			of the wild women you forgot<br>
			We are the stories you thought<br>
			would never be taught.<br>
			<br>
			They should have checked the ashes<br>
			of the women they buried alive.<br>
			Because it takes a single wild ember <br>
			to bring a whole wildfire to life.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			The Truth About Monsters:<br>
			<br>
			The truth is this,<br>
			every monster you have met <br>
			or will ever meet,<br>
			was once a human being<br>
			with a soul that was soft<br>
			and light<br>
			as silk.<br>
			<br>
			Someone stole<br>
			that silk from their soul <br>
			and turned them<br>
			into this.<br>
			<br>
			So when you see <br>
			a monster next,<br>
			always remember this.<br>
			Do not fear the thing <br>
			before you.<br>
			Fear the thing that<br>
			created it instead.

			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this lab is to stylize our site with new CSS techniques
			 like text-shadow, gradient backgrounds, image filters, and rounded corners.</p>

			<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab was super refreshing after the brain melting typography labs,
			so it actually seemed super easy and simple. I would also like to note that
		  I have used some of these elements in previous labs because I typically
		  scroll through w3schools and find new things to try. With that being said,
		  text shadows, image filters and transforms are the ones I have used before.
		  So yes, overall this lab was not challenging at all and everything ran smoothly.</p>
		 </main>

	 <main id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>If everything came out as planned, then my site should look a more stylized
			than normal! My images should be filtered, my corners rounded, my background
		  a gradient, and my text and boxes shadowed.</p></div>
