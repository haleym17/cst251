<p>Hi my name is Haley, in all honesty I wish we were allowed to write our
names without capitilization all the time because h looks better than H. When
it comes to talking about myself, I feel like it's hard to know what to say
because I know everything about me. But what parts of myself should I share
with others? Yeah, that question serves as a total road block. Anyways, I am 19,
a sagittarius, and a mom to a cat and a gecko. I feel like sometimes I come off
as cold towards people, it's not intentional at all, I just focus on what I
think is important.</p>
