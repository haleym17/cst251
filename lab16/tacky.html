			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this lab is to stylize our site with new CSS techniques
			that were introduced to us during class like columns, transitions, animations,
			and backgrounds.</p>
		</main>

		<main id="challenges">
			<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
			<p>Similar to the previous lab, this one was refreshing compared to labs 13
			and 14. I really like messing around with CSS especially when it comes to making
		  the content look a little bit prettier. For the limited amount of words I have
		  I think the columns look quite wonky so I am attempting to write more than usual.
			Is there a way to just do vertical columns so that purpose, challenges, and results
			could be in their own columns rather than breaking them up midway? Perhaps
			there is a way to do that and I am just overlooking it so hmmm.
			For my background animation color change I am wondering if there is a way to
			have it as a continuous loop because at the moment it lasts for four seconds
			and I have to refresh the page for it to start over.
		 </p>

	 <main id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>If everything came out as planned, then my site should look a more stylized
			than normal! For this particular lab, my text will be in columns, my
		  background is animated to change colors, and there are several transitions.
