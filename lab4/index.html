    <h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
		<p> The purpose of this lab is test our local files and upload them to the
			server.
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> I did not run across any problems for this lab. I actually thought we
			had to use github and push to origin for all of the past assignments, so
			I have been doing all of these steps already. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> As of right now you are viewing the index.html, however it was already
			made in the template so I did not have to create it myself.</p>
