		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose for this lab is to work with text elements to ehance our
			website. With my partner as per usual, I created a lab10 folder containing
		 an index.html file, a css stylesheet, and an image folder. I will be building
	   up with my knowledge from the previous lab while adding new elements from
	   this one.</p>

		<p> Luckily, I did not have any problems with today's lab. I am honestly
		super tired as I am writing this and am so glad to be done so I can fall
	  asleep; I should have done this earlier on but I pushed it off until tonight.
	  I am definitely not one hundred percent with everything, and a lot
	  of times I refer back to w3schools, but I think I am doing a satisfactory job
	  for not having any experience beforehand. There are things that I still feel
	  uncertain about but I honestly cannot think of anything off the top of my head
    at this exact moment. Anyways, goodnight to me.</p> </main>

	<p> There is a certain beauty in setting the world on fire, and watching from
		the center of the flames.</p><br>
	<p> Until the lambs become lions.</p><br>
	<p> The child who is not embraced by the village, will burn it down to feel
		it's warmth.</p><br>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Viola, if everything has gone to plan which I know it has otherwise I would
		not have published this to my official site, theeeeen you should be seeing
	  fonts that have not previously been used on any og my labs. Seeing as I typically
	  stick with Arial, I am sure that this is a welcome sight. </p>
