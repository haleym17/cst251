  <h1>Lab 5 More HTML</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab and all of its respective tasks is to create a
		webpage which contains multiple images and links.</p>
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p> This lab did not have anything really new in it, so I did not have any
	challeneges. However, on atom my img was turning orange rather than red, and
   when I did the second img a line below it worked perfectly. So, I am a little
    confused as to why that one did not also turn red. So when you look at my
	 atom screenshot the "alt="flowernflies.png" width=500>" before the actual
  images is the only way they both turned red. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> The website you are looking at in this moment is proof of lab 5's html
		file, and the following images are two random digital art pieces I did for
		a class last semester. </p
